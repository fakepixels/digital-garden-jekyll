## GOAL
want to refine the craft of learning

want to seek the truth

want to profoundly understand the complexity of the world

want to act on the newly discovered truth  

…are rational optimists (this is important!)

## PUBLIC RESEARCH
Most of us here are likely practitioners in the real world, fidgeting with questions, questioning the status quo, and unsatisfied with the complacency of the average... 

The explorations happening here is as gratifying and challenging as attending grad schools of social sciences etc.

## COLLABORATIVE EXECUTION
Talk is nothing without actions. Being intellectually rigorous and curious is a prerequisite, but is far from sufficient. I hope we hold each other accountable to also execute on our collective ideas by

Investing or building great enterprises

Publishing content

Organizing local community 

## WHAT TO EXPECT
CONTENT
Unfiltered analyses of industries, large enterprises, economy, and the chaos of nation-state

Basic sense-making

Neutralizing extremist opinions, especially extremist in the disguise of some sexy ideologies and escapism 

Raw inquiry into cultural, technological, and economic issues including but not limited to: 

US/ China: The Great Stagnation & The Great Leap Forward

The Great Stagnation is the idea propagated by the economist Tyler Cowen, who argues that the American economy has reached a historical technological plateau and the factors that drove economic growth for most of America's history are no longer present. The Great Leap Forward was an economic and social campaign led by Chairman Mao to reconstruct the CCP from an agrarian economy into a communist society through mobilizing people's communes.

The Plateau and The Leap — how will these two ideas shaped our understanding of the identities of modern Americans and the modern Chinese, the tension between which will create the most defining game of our time. The pandemic seemed to make the choice between totalitarianism that would sacrifice rights to optimize for the public goods and democracy that would unite us at the cost of operational leverage. 

Digital identity, privacy, and governance 

Our identity has become increasingly fragmented online and we have somewhat very little control over how both of our individual and collective identities get promoted and vilified, the amplitude of which has been highly levered by the distribution of social platforms… 

How do we govern individuals and organizations, holding them accountable, while still keeping the Internet a better place? 

Global Diaspora: The politics of migration & what it means to be a global citizen

We grew up as a generation that’s deeply impacted by the idea of transnationalism, hybridity cosmopolitanism, and creolization (referring to the process by which elements of different cultures are blended together to create a new culture). Exploring what it means to be a global citizen isn’t just an economic exercise (which we’re also quite good at), but a cultural and psychological one. 

The metaphors that define us 

To see the present clearly is to recognize all the metaphors we use to construct the present. This is an exercise to examine how the language we use around us defines our daily discourse. 

‘Covid-ian’ military metaphors marshal us to valorize ‘front-line workers’ – those deemed ‘essential’ to the medical, economic, social, and of course, political establishment. Donald Trump, America’s ‘wartime President’ delivers his briefings, surrounded by a ‘task force’ that includes his impotent ‘Surgeon General’, while he engages in a war of words with journalists. The Pentagon flies synchronized fighter jets, absurdly named Blue Angels and Thunderbirds, to offer tribute to a nation still at war with both viruses and words…

The violence of a living consumer

Examine how our consumer behaviors impact the environment, the labor from afar, and one another. 

Metrics beyond GDP

This widespread use of GDP has resulted in an incomplete accounting of some of society’s key measures of wellbeing: GDP doesn’t account for the distribution of goods; doesn’t factor in work in the household; and increases under calamity as well as success. GDP cannot express efficiency, quality, or access.

…so much more

Examine the other side of public narratives including but not limited to:

Political statements

Marketing/PR campaigns

Public personas

DISCUSSIONS, FACILITATED BY MEDIA
Monthly discussions facilitated by a book, a paper, a blog post, an article, a podcast etc.

Over time, we will accrue templates and workbooks to make this easier for us. 

PROJECTS
Host local events, community engagement, lead an inter-company initiative, participate in board discussion etc.

COMMITMENT
One member should expect to contribute one of the above (content, discussions, or project) lead one session every month. 

WHAT NOT TO EXPECT
Polish

Perfect grammar

Lack of typo

Performance

Performative behavior isn’t welcomed here. We all need to perform in this world, that’s why a private group like this should be sacred and preserved. 

Networking (UGHHHHHHH…) 

You’re still welcome to make friends with one another, and the choice is yours whether you ever want to reveal your true identity. 

BUT THIS IS LITERALLY ON YOUR PERSONAL SITE!
Sorry, but this is the easiest way for me to host a password-protected website and I don’t want to pay extra to use a separate platform! Everyone here probably knows my identity and likely has seen my face. As a member of the group, you can use a pseudonym, and you’d have to trust me that I’ll preserve the identity. This is highly bootstrapped, so hopefully, I can create the infrastructure to make this truly a safe place. 

Over time, I hope to create a tokenized, and completely decentralized community where the access to the group is gated by a wallet authentication process, namely, how much $OVER you hold. You will have the right to transfer ownership, but it has to be approved by the group. 

I’ll probably still be sharing publicly the thesis, research, and personal journey in the world of entrepreneurship, innovation, and venture capital via Fakepixels. I’ll remain honest there as well, but there’s also a lot that I don’t feel comfortable sharing there.
